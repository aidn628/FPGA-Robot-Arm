# FPGA-Robot-Arm
A simple robot arm that can replay movements based on a custom processor implemented in Verilog. Originally developed as a final project for ECE 350 at Duke University taught by Dr. John Board. [VIDEO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-UmbdNB6UNFUb3LTS1fIPVzV7RNHBnE/view?usp=sharing)

## CAD Implementation
All CAD files were created in Solidworks 2022 under an education license. All assemblies are located in the 'Assemblies' folder, all external parts (servos, bearings, etc.) are in the 'External Parts' folder, and all the parts that were 3D printed are in the 'Manufactured Parts' folder. These together should give an idea of how the arm operates and can be manufactured.
